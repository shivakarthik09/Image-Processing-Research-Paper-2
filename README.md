Potato Leaf Disease Classification System with a Neural Approach to Invariant Feature Recognition
Abstract
<br>
The Potato Leaf Disease Identification System addresses the critical issue of early detection and classification of diseases affecting potato plants, specifically Early Blight and Late Blight. With agriculture being a vital source of sustenance for a significant portion of the global population, any loss in crop yield due to diseases can have severe consequences. The inability to identify and treat these diseases promptly leads to decreased productivity, resulting in financial losses for farmers and food scarcity for consumers.
<br>
To mitigate these challenges, leveraging Deep Learning techniques is developed. The core of the system is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, renowned for its proficiency in image classification tasks. A dataset comprising leaf images categorized into three classes - Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight - forms the basis for training the model. Before training, the dataset undergoes preprocessing and augmentation processes to enhance its quality and diversity. Techniques such as reshaping, rescaling, resizing, and rotation are employed to augment the dataset, thereby improving the model's accuracy and robustness.

Additionally, the project explores novel methodologies to enhance the model's ability to learn invariances in the data. One approach involves training the model with original unaugmented images and testing it on shuffled pixel images to evaluate its robustness to variations in input data. Furthermore, different augmentation combinations are explored to optimize model performance. The use of a pretrained ResNet-50 network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification further enriches the system's capabilities.

The project aims to empower farmers with an automated tool for the early detection and diagnosis of potato leaf diseases, enabling them to implement timely interventions and safeguard their crop yield. By harnessing the capabilities of Deep Learning and advanced image processing techniques, the proposed system seeks to alleviate the adverse impacts of diseases on agricultural productivity, thereby contributing to food security and economic stability.
